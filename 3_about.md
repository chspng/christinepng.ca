<h1 style="font-weight: bold">My name is Christine, and I’m a designer. </h1>
<p>
<p >What I really care about is conveying information in ways that are both accurate and visually compelling. In particular, I’m excited to do this by creating data visualizations. 

<p>I also teach data visualization and design by giving workshops and lecture for both corporate and academic settings.

<p>I'm currently the Information Design Manager at <a href="https://www.ccohealth.ca/en" >Cancer Care Ontario</a>, where I work across analytics teams to create effective and expressive visualizations for the healthcare system.
During my Masters of Science in Biomedical Communications at the <a href="https://bmc.med.utoronto.ca/bmc/">University of Toronto</a> I learned to use a range of visual techniques, but regardless of medium, my goal remains to communicate information clearly and effectively to my audience.   


<p>If you have an infomation or biomedical visualization challenge to solve, or are looking for someone to speak or teach on information design, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact/">send me a message</a> and I'll be in touch!</p>

title: UX Redesign of PubMed
description: This project proposes a redesign of PubMed, a research database for biomedical literature. Accessing relevant literature is an important step in the process of conducting scientific research, and PubMed provides a key service in this area. We sought to understand the concerns of people who conduct biomedical research, identify areas for potential improvement with the existing platform, and propose improvements to the PubMed interface in order to enhance the research process.<p> This project was created in collaboration with Matan Berson (<a href="http://www.matanberson.com/">matanberson.com</a>).

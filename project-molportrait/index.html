title: Molecular portrait
description: This project focused on presenting molecular information in a visually engaging way. When developing 3D visuals, perhaps the most important components are effective use of composition, lighting and texturing. The protein structure was obtained from the Protein Data Bank to ensure scientific accuracy, and therefore the main design challenge was focused on the composition, lighting and texturing.

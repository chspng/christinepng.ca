title: Mechanisms of Anthracycline Action
description: Anthracyclines are a class of drug used to treat cancer. This project conveys four hypotheses for Anthracycline mechanism of action. It was created in consultation with Dr. Marsela Braunstein, and intended for display in a scientific publication. <p>I began by reviewing the scientific literature on this topic, then sketching out designs to discuss with the content advisor. Once the accuracy of the scientific content was confirmed, I created a vector version of the design, which received further feedback from both peers and faculty members. All this iteration resulted in the final piece.

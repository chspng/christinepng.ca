This presentation slide was created to illustrate one of the proposed mechanisms of action of Anthracycline, a breast cancer drug. It was created under the guidance of Professor Michael Corrin at the University of Toronto, and in collaboration with Dr. Marsela Braunstein at the Ontario Institute of Cancer Research. 

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/process/anth3d-1.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/process/anth3d-2.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Draft sketches
</div>

The design of it focused on developing a visually engaging story with minimal textual components, in order to keep an audience focused on the presenter's explanation, rather than the slide.

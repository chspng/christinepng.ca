This project was created early in my training as a biomedical communicator at the University of Toronto, under the guidance of Professor Dave Mazierski. 

I used carbon dust to convey the anatomical form, and added text in Adobe Illustrator. 

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/process/sketch_hand.jpg" alt="A pencil sketch of the superficial palm" title="superficial palm"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/process/sketch_nasal_septum.jpg" alt="A pencil sketch of the nasal septum" title="nasal septum"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/process/sketch_footbones.jpg" alt="A pencil sketch of the bones of the foot" title="bones of the foot"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">

</div>

The research stage involved studying real anatomical specimens, taken together with reference texts. Once the initial sketch was reviewed and verified for accuracy, I used carbon dust to render the bones.

<div class="img_row">
	<div class="col one"></div>
	<!-- <img class="col two" src="" alt="" title=""/> -->
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/process/render_footbones.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<div class="col one"></div>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">

The final step was to scan and clean up, and add labels.
<div class="img_full">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/final/bonesofthefoot.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>

<div class="col three caption">

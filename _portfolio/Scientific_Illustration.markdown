In my training as a biomedical communicator, I developed proficiency at communicating scientific content using a range of visual media. 

Each project shown below involved a significant research stage to understand the content, and several design iterations before the final product was created.

One of the first projects I created was a carbon dust drawing of the bones of the foot, created under the guidance of Professor Dave Mazierski at the University of Toronto. 

<div class="img_full">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/final/bonesofthefoot.jpg" alt="Carbon dust of the bones of the foot" title="Bones of the foot"/>
	
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Bones of the Foot, by Christine P'ng
</div>

Line art is another common visual approach for conveying form, which I used to distinguish the many muscles, tendons, nerves, and blood vessels found in the superficial palm. 

<div class="img_full_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/final/supficialpalm.png" alt="Line drawing of the superficial palm" title="Line drawing of the superficial palm"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Superficial Palm, by Christine P'ng
</div>

I also learned how to use 3D modelling software to illustrate scientific content. In this project I chose to model a human enzyme involved in DNA winding, topoisomerase. This project was created under the guidance of Professor Nick Woolridge, at the University of Toronto.

<div class="img_full">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/final/topoisomerase-full.jpg" alt="3D rendering of topoisomerase" title="Topoisomerase"/>
</div>

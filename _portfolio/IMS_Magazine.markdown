I worked on the graphic design for the IMS Magazine, at the University of Toronto. This involved designing the type and layout of the magazine pages, as well as creating illustrations and graphical elements. 

<div class="img_full_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/final/ims_infographic.jpg" alt="Timeline of Respiratory Medicine" title="Timeline of Respiratory Medicine"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Respiratory Medicine, by Christine P'ng
</div>

As an example, one graphic I created was this infographic timeline for the IMS Magazine's spring 2017 issue, which was focused on respiratory medicine. This two-page spread highlights some of the key figures and breakthroughs in respiratory medicine over time.

I enjoyed working on this magazine - typography is one my design joys, and so putting together magazine pages was a great way to try out new fonts and combinations! 

Developing the illustrations, such as the infographic timeline shown above, was also something I enjoyed designing and developing.

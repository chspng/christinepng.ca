As part of my interview process at CCO, I developed an interactive data visualization project to communicate screening statistics in Ontario. The process involved rapid iteration and user feedback to develop this prototype within a two-week window. 

I designed it as a tool to aid marketers develop screening campaigns. The project begins with providing on overview to cancer care in Ontario, then gives an introduction to various cancer types, and finally presents data on current screening rates, incidence and mortality, and demographic information.

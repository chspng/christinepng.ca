	Illustration of a proposed mechanism of action for Anthracycline, by Christine P'ng
</div>

One of my favourite rendering styles is cell-shading. This presentation slide was created to illustrate one of the proposed mechanisms of action of Anthracycline, a breast cancer drug. It was created under the guidance of Professor Michael Corrin at the University of Toronto, and in collaboration with Dr. Marsela Braunstein at the Ontario Institute of Cancer Research.

	Draft sketches

I began this project by researching the scientific backgroud, by reading relevant journal articles and meeting with the content expert to confirm and clarify understanding. I then created draft sketches for review and feedback before rendering the final version.

The design of this slide focused on creating a visually engaging story with minimal textual components, in order to keep an audience focused on the presenter's explanation, rather than the slide.

		            I began by studying life sciences and quickly discovered a love of design and programming. After finishing my undergraduate studies, I worked in a cancer research lab where I developed data visualizations, journal figures and visual narratives for scientific communication. Nowadays I'm finishing my Master's degree in Biomedical Communications. When Iâ€™m not working on my research project, I can be found reading a good book, walking through the woods, or reflecting on how to build strong communities.

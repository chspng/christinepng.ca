		  	<p class="text-muted">My name is Christine, and I’m a designer. I love thinking about how people perceive visuals. I happily spend my time developing media for positive user experiences. What I really care about is conveying information in ways that are both accurate and visually compelling. In particular, I’m excited to do this by creating data visualizations for scientific research and healthcare.

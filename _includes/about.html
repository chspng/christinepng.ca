                <p class="text-faded text-left">I'm a designer and programmer. I started by working on data visualization research for a cancer research lab while also doing a variety of graphics work: everything from designing journal figures, choosing colours, making comics, and more. I love thinking about how people perceive and understand designs. I see scientific communication as primarily an educational field, and I want to make science more understandable, both for scientists and the general public.</p>

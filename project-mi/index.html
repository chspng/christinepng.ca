title: Pathophysiology of a Myocardial Infarction
description: The challenge in this project was to design a layout which allowed an educated lay audience to follow multiple levels of scale along with a clear disease progression. Mycardial infarctions in particular follow a very time-sensitive progression, and this required the layout to maintain an accurate time scale. While designing this, I imagined what kinds of questions a reader of this graphic would be asking. Because this pathology is relatively common, they may be particularly interested in how to identify a myocardial infarction, and key time points and complications to be wary of. Much of the time spent on this piece was in researching the pathophysiology and designing an effective layout.

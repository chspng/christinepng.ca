title: Pathophysiology of a Myocardial Infarction
description: Myocardial infarctions (commonly known as heart attacks) occur when a region of the heart begins to die because of inadequate blood supply. This project was created with the goal of conveying the pathophysiology of myocardial infarctions at multiple scales. <p>The research process began with investigating the cellular environment of the heart to understand how heart muscle fibres were interconnected, and what other cellular elements were involved in normal circumstances. I also researched thrombosis as a common cause of myocardial infarctions (I ended up not having enough space in the final design to include this process). I went through many iterations of the layout. The biggest design constraint here was maintaining a readable timeline â€“ in myocardial infarctions, there are key time points where cellular and gross level changes occur, with many more changes occuring in first week. Once I settled on a clear design, I drafted colour palettes and rendered the final piece.

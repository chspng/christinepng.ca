title: Pathophysiology of a Myocardial Infarction
description: This project focused on clearly conveying disease progression at multiple scales. The challenge was to keep each level of scale clearly depicted, and at the same time relate each to the disease time progression. Much of the time spent on this piece was in researching the pathophysiology and designing an effective layout.

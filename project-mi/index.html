title: Pathophysiology of a Myocardial Infarction
description: This project explored effective methods of displaying disease progression at multiple scales. The challenge was to keep each level of scale clearly depicted, and at the same time relate each to the disease time progression.<p>The vast majority of time spent on this piece was in the research and design phases. The disease progression had to be understood at both cellular and gross levels, as well as its clinical significance. Once the research was completed, the overall design of the project went through extensive iteration to find an effective solution.

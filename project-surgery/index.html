title: Cervical decompression and fusion
description: This project focuses on accuracy and clear storytelling. I observed the surgery to take initial sketches of the process. Based on these notes I consulted with textbooks and other reference materials to develop a more accurate depiction of the process. My work was reviewed several times by anatomists, medical illustrators, as well as the performing surgeon to ensure accuracy and clarity. Creating this piece demanded extensive iteration to arrive at the final output.

title: Surgical illustration
description: I had the privilege of observing a cervical decompression and fusion in order to illustrate the procedure. To create this piece I began by taking sketches of the process while the surgery was being performed. Based on these initial notes and additional research, I crafted a narrative of the process based on its key steps. The illustration then underwent many iterations to improve its accuracy and clarity.

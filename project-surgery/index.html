title: Cervical decompression and fusion
description: This project focused on developing clear and accurate storytelling. I was able to observe and sketch the procedure live, and these initial notes formed the basis for extensive  research to ensure accurate depiction of both the process and anatomy. Many iterations of the storytelling were explored to determine effective viewpoints and number of figures required.

description: Learning to work hard
---
<p>Over the past year, I've been fortunate to receive life advice from people older and wiser than me. Out of all the things I've been taught, there are few lessons that have stayed with me: how to stop overthinking and stick with a decision, how to set realistic goals and manage time effectively, how to ask for help and learn from other people. There's one lesson in particular that has been salient in my mind, and will continue to be in the coming months as I wrap up my Master's work: how to work hard. 

<hr>

<p>In my graduate program, there are a few ways of finding a Master's Research Program. The most common method is selecting from a list of proposed projects, which come with a preassembled committee and (occasionally) funding. I opted to instead create my project from scratch: deciding my own topic, presentation method, audience, purpose, and finding my own committee. 

<p>I did this because I had a strong sense of what skillset I wanted to further develop and what topics I cared about. I wanted to do something with data visualization and interactive design, and I wanted it to be about poverty. However, the process of deciding the scope, learning the content and finding committee members was difficult. It seemed so much easier to go for a project that already came with these things. Early on in the process, I was lamenting over these struggles with a mentor, who told me: 

<blockquote>
	Don't be afraid of hard work.
</blockquote>

<p>That was exactly what I needed to hear. I'm not doing this project because I think it will be easy. I know that it's going to be hard. I'm not doing this project only to have a pretty portfolio piece or to gain technical skills. Of course that's part of it, but more importantly I'm learning to choose what matters to me over what's easy for me. I'm learning to challenge myself in areas where I'm weak. I'm learning to embrace the discipline of hard work.

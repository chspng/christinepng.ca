description: Taking note of things I have learned over the past year
---
<p>Over the past year, I've been fortunate to receive life advice from people older and wiser than me. Out of all the things I've learned, there are few lessons that have stayed with me, the first of which is this:

<hr>

<p>In my graduate program, there are a few ways of finding a Master's Research Program. The most common method is selecting from a list of proposed projects, which come with a preassembled committee and (occasionally) funding. I opted to instead create my project from scratch: deciding my own topic, presentation method, audience, purpose, and finding my own committee. 

<p>I did this because I had a strong sense of what skillset I wanted to further develop and what topics I cared about. I wanted to do something with data visualization and interactive design, and I wanted it to be about poverty. However, the process of deciding the scope, learning the content and finding committee members was difficult. It seemed so much easier to go for a project that already came with these things. Early on in the process, I was lamenting over these struggles with a mentor, who told me: 

<blockquote>
	Don't be afraid of hard work.
</blockquote>

<p>At the time, that what exactly what I needed to hear. I'm not doing this project because I think it will be easy. I know that it's going to be hard. I'm not doing this project only to have a pretty portfolio piece or to gain technical skills. Of course that's part of it, but more importantly I'm learning to choose what matters to me over what's easy for me. I'm learning to challenge myself in areas where I'm weak. I'm learning to embrace the discipline of hard work.

<!-- <hr>

<p>The second major lesson came out of my tendency to overthink decisions. I want to collect all and weigh all the relevant data surrounding a choice before I make it. While this works in some situations, One of my strengths is careful planning and organization, I am very good at planning and being organized. When making choices, I consider and weigh all possible outcomes. This is good  

<blockquote>
	Make a choice and stick with it.
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Finally, one of the meaningful books I read this year was <i>The Road to Character</i>, by David Brooks. I read it because I was trying to articulate who I wanted to be. I'm at a stage in my life where I'm looking to start a career, and with that comes dreams of what my professional life will be. What kind of job will I seek? What kind of work will I do? How will weigh the factors in this choice? Will I aim for well-paid and prestigious positions? Will I focus on work that I find meaningful and does good in the world? What kind of life will I seek?

<blockquote>
	Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime; therefore we must be saved by hope. Nothing which is true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history; therefore we must be saved by faith. Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone; therefore we must be saved by love. No virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as it is from our standpoint. Therefore we must be saved by the final form of love which is forgiveness.

	- Reinhold Niebuhr

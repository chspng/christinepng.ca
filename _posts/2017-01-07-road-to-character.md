description: A review of <i>The Road to Character</i>, by David Brooks
---
<p>There are three future time points in my life I try to set goals for: 1 year, 5 years, and at the end of my life. For example, in one year I hope to be working in a field relevant to my education. In 5 years' time I want to be a decently proficient cook. 

<p>However, when I think about the end of my life, things like career success and practical life skills don't matter as much. For this stage, I wonder if I will have succeeded in living up to my values, if I've built character, been faithful and compassionate, and learned humility. One helpful book I read on this topic was <i>The Road to Character</i>, by David Brooks. I read it because I'm at a stage in life where I don't know exactly what I'll be doing next. I'm graduating soon, and with that comes making choices about what work I seek to do and what kind of person I will be. 

<p>In this book, David Brooks looks at a range of people who served some great cause, looking at their childhood upbringing, formative life events, sacrifices they made, and ultimately what kinds of character they built. I found most of them inspiring, and reading the book made me wonder: what does it look like for me to do good work?

<p>By the end of the book, I also felt overwhelmed. Here were all these people who gave up so much and did so much good, and here I am, young and confused about what I should be doing with my life. Fortunately, Brooks brings up a quotation near the end of the book that I found helpful:

<blockquote>
	Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime; therefore we must be saved by hope. Nothing which is true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history; therefore we must be saved by faith. Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone; therefore we must be saved by love. No virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as it is from our standpoint. Therefore we must be saved by the final form of love which is forgiveness.

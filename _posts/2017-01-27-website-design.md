description: Why this website is not done 
---
<p>When I tell people I have a website and they ask to see it, I always hope they'll open it in front of me. That way I get to watch over their shoulder as they navigate (I strongly believe in user testing). I also get to see how my site looks on devices I hadn't predicted or tested for (Blackberry still exists). 

<p>The first issue that comes up: those little icons that bounce and highlight my favourite things? Everyone tries to click them. After watching multiple people poke at non-pokeable elements, I remembered that when I first saw portfolio sites that used similar icons, I too tried to click them. I thought at the time, "This is so misleading! When <i>I</i> set up my site, I'll use these icons to filter my portfolio items!" Alas, that functionality fell to the <i>Future Implementation</i> task list, below the <i>Get Website Live</i> deadline. Now I have a few choices: 
<p>
<ol type="a">
	<li>Do nothing</li>
	<li>Implemet clickable icons</li>
	<li>Remove icons</li>
	<li>Continue getting user feedback: Do people like the icons? Does it help them understand who I am? Are there too many of them? Do they still look clickable if they don't bounce? <i>What are people expecting to happen when they click those icons?</i></li>
</ol>

<p>If it's not obvious, I tend toward the last option: research to better understand how people interact with interfaces. Then I make the change. Then I watch over a few more peoples' shoulders. Then I start working on and thinking about the next change. Then I do it all again. (This is why my website will never be done.)

<p>And until then, I hope you can ignore those button-impersonating icons.

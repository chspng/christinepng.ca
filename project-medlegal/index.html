title: Pierre v. Marshall
description: This project was designed to inform a courtroom jury of the key events and scientific processes of a medical malpractice case. The challenge was to convey complex time-sequence and medical information to a lay audience. In this case, a physician failed to test for and take appropriate precautions against gestational diabetes in an expectant mother, which led to the development of macrosomic baby, resulting in complications at delivery. It is intended for display on three 30" by 40" printed panels. <p>This piece was created in collaboration with Jung Hee Lee and Joanna Liang.

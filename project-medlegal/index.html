title: Pierre v. Marshall
description: This project was designed to inform a courtroom jury of the key events and scientific processes of the case of Pierre v. Marshall. This was a medical malpractice case where the physician failed to test for and take appropriate precautions against gestational diabetes in the expectant mother. This led to the development of macrosomic baby, which resulted in complications at delivery. It is intended for display on three 30" by 40" printed panels. <p>This piece was created in collaboration with Jung Hee Lee and Joanna Liang.

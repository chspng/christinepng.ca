title: Tale of Two Adams
subtitle: A narrative data visualization on homelessness and health

intro: This project explores the relationship between homelessness and mortality rates in Canada. It follows the lives of two characters, Adam A and Adam B, who are very similar, but for one main difference. Adam B is homeless and Adam A is housed. 

design_challenges: I knew from the outset that I wanted to develop something in the field of data visualization, and I wanted to challenge myself to work outside my comfort zone. Most of my prior experience with data visualization was created for an academic audience, and with this project I decided to target the general public, which forced me to communicate with more clarity and with fewer assumptions about what the viewer would already know. I also chose to work with a different kind of dataset than I was accustomed to, which pushed me to think more creatively about how it might be communicated. Finally, I chose a topic that I cared about, but one which was also surrounded with stigma and misconceptions. <p>One early challenge was determining how to limit the scope and focus of the project. Homelessness and health is very broad, and even with giving an introduction to the topic of homelessness in general, the project could have easily become too large to complete in the limited time I had. I began with a list of research data I wanted to include, and eventually limited the project to focus on differences in mortality rates. <p>Designing the communication method also went through early challenges. I had initially envisioned a project that described the relationship between homelessness and health purely through population-level data visualizations. This changed to incorporating an individual narrative intertwined with the data visualizations to encourage a more empathetic reception.

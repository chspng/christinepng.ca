title: Tale of Two Adams
subtitle: A narrative data visualization on homelessness and health

intro: This project explores the relationship between homelessness and health in Canada, by focusing on mortality rates. Its aim is to generate empathy towards the homeless in Canada and improve understanding of their circumstances. The design challenge it faces is how to convey epidemiological data in an engaging and empathetic format for a lay audience. <p>The solution (in progress) is to combine data visualizations with a personal graphic narrative, thus conveying both population-level and individual-level stories. The individual narrative follows the lives of two characters, Adam A and Adam B, who are very similar but for one main difference. Adam B is homeless and Adam A is housed. 

design_challenges: I knew from the outset that I wanted to develop something in the field of data visualization, and I also wanted to challenge myself to work outside my comfort zone. Most of my previous work was created for an academic audience, and with this project I decided to instead design for the general public. This forced me to communicate with more clarity and with fewer assumptions about what the viewer would already know. I also chose to work with a different kind of dataset than I was accustomed to, which pushed me to think more creatively about how it might be communicated. Finally, I chose a topic that I cared about, but one which was also surrounded with stigma and misconceptions, which led me to iterate through many rounds of user testing. <p>One early challenge was determining how to limit the scope and focus of the project. Homelessness and health is a very broad topic, and the project could have easily become too large to complete in the limited timeframe available to me. After reviewing the scientific literature, I decided to limit the project to focus on differences in mortality rates between homeless and housed populations in Canada. <p>Designing the communication method also went through early challenges. I had initially envisioned a project that described the relationship between homelessness and health purely through population-level data visualizations. This changed to incorporating an individual narrative intertwined with the data visualizations to encourage a more empathetic reception. 

process_desc: I went through many iterations of the narrative to check for coherency and response, the wireframes to investigate how a viewer would navigate the project, and the overall look and feel of the project. <p>Here is a sample of an early storyboard draft.
